        The following sources were submitted on your behalf with the Office of the Claims Administrator's Claims Portal for the Phase 1 3M and DuPont claims. Please review the sources and update the data as needed. If you have a source that is not listed here and you would like to either add that source or would like to get advice on whether a new source should be added, please <a href="{% url 'contact' %}">contact</a> EH&E immediately. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For each source listed below, please review the following information by clicking on the <i class="bi bi-eye-fill"></i> icon: 
        <ul>
            <li><b>PFAS results: </b>If you have a <em>higher</em> PFAS result than what was reported for Phase 1 3M and DuPont claims, please update the result and provide us with a corresponding lab report. If a previously unimpacted source now has PFAS detections, please proceed to the source page, provide PFAS results and max flow rate and annual production. . If you are waiting on Q4 testing results, you may update these values any time before the claims filing deadline of March 2, 2024 (subject to change).</li>
            <li><b>Max Flow Rate: </b>This is unlikely to change but if you have a document that shows a higher max flow rate, please  update this value.</li>
            <li><b>Annual Production: </b>For each impacted source below, i.e., sources with a Source Status of PFAS detected in the table below, please provide annual production for 2023. If the source is unimpacted, annual production is not needed at this time.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have no updates or corrections to make, no action is needed on your behalf at this time. EH&E or your legal team will be in contact once the Tyco and BASF claims are ready to be submitted with the Office of the Claims Administrator.

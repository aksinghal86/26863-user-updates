This is a file to list the types of tests and use cases the website serves to accomplish:

(1) Updating PFAS results:

- if the result is lower than the pre-populated result in the dashboard, does an error message appear?
    -Yes

- verify error message that sampling date cannot be in the future
    - verified

- verify error message that analysis date cannot be before the sampling date
    - verified

- verify that updating a PFAS result to something higher can be made
    - did not work properly... added another row to the PFAS results page without an analyte listed
    - the entry was sent to the database; however, it is missing a row_names field, sample_id field, analyte field, and
    a file name field.
    - the lab report was not uploaded to the corresponding dropbox folder
